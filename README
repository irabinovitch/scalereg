1. INTRODUCTION

Scalereg is the registration system used by SCALE, the Southern
California Linux Expo. This registration software helped us run a
smooth show for over 1000 attendees during SCALE 6X and SCALE 7X. We
are releasing this code so other Open Source conferences can benefit
from it as well.

The SCALE Registration System (scalereg) is written in Python and uses
the Django framework.

You can find more about the projects mentioned above at their
respective websites:

2. REQUIREMENTS

To run Scalereg, you need the following:

- Django 1.0 which in turn requires:
  - any Python version from 2.3 to 2.6, Python 2.5+ preferred. [1]
  - a database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, etc)

[1] Most testing has been with Python 2.5. Please report
    incompatibilities with python 2.3 or 2.4.

3. GETTING STARTED

After extracting the Scalereg tarball, from the top-level directory
of the Scalereg source (which contains this file), go to the scalereg/
directory that contains settings.py.

Now edit settings.py and make sure all the settings look correct. By
default, we use a SQLite database since it requires minimal setup.
Please generate a unique SECRET_KEY in settings.py; any valid python
string works. Also change the path in TEMPLATE_DIRS with the full path
to scalereg/scale_templates.  With the application configured, run the
following command to initial the database:

./manage.py syncdb

To load some sample data:

./manage.py loaddata fixtures/sample_data.xml

And to start the webserver:

./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080

Assuming all went smoothly, go to http://hostname:8080/admin to
configure the registration site, and http://hostname:8080/reg6
to try out the registration software.

If you want to integrate Scalereg with your web server software or
your database software, please see the Django website for more info on
"Deploying Django".
